# Overview

As a software engineer, I created this project to practice setting up a Python
development environment and writing a basic Python program. This project helped
me confirm that my tools are working correctly and that I can successfully run
Python code.

The software is a simple Python program that prints messages to the console.

The purpose of this software is to verify my Python setup and begin practicing
basic programming concepts.
